# ***********************************************************
# Thought Machine Example Values File:
#  Information:
#   - Values with defaults are set to their default value and commented out.
#   - Docstrings are denoted by '#    >' to differentiate them from default values.
#   - Values without defaults are set to an example value and left uncommented.
#   - Values can depend on one another using Go templating (with Sprig) of the form `svc_url: '<<¬¬.Values.my.instance.url¬¬>>/svc'`.
#     We use the custom delimiters `<<¬¬` and `¬¬>>` to prevent clashes with go templates in the values.
#     Templates will be applied after defaults are merged.
